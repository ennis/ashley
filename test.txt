Input: 
List of strokes (instead of polygons)
Strokes are inflated to polygons in a geometry shader (or mesh shader, most likely). They

Q: representation of strokes? Polylines?

In a first pass, the strokes are rasterized in a low-res target, each pixel represents a "tile" (16x16 px) containing the list of strokes hitting the tile.
Q: How to represent this list of strokes? A list of IDs.



In a second pass, for each tile, for each pixel in the tile,
evaluate the value of the pixel by accumulating the contribution of all strokes.

Q: how does a stroke contribute to a pixel?
A: Each stroke is a distance field to a polyline, with color attributes



Issues:
Shadows? You can't derive visibility information from strokes only (they may not be fully covering the object), and in this scheme there's no b-rep of the object. 
=> Shadow maps are not pixels, but projected strokes
